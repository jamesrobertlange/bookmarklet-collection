# Bookmarklet Collection

This repository contains a collection of useful bookmarklets for web development, SEO, and general web browsing. Each bookmarklet is available in three versions: minified, unminified, and console-ready.

## Bookmarklet Versions

1. **Minified**: These are compact, single-line versions of the bookmarklets, optimized for use as actual bookmarklets in your browser. They have the smallest file size but are difficult to read and modify.
- **Please Note**: you need to add "javascript:" prior to the minified version to use this code as a bookmarklet.


2. **Unminified**: These are the full, readable versions of the bookmarklets. They include proper formatting, comments, and are easier to understand and modify. Use these if you want to study or customize the bookmarklets.

3. **Console-ready**: These versions are designed to be pasted directly into the browser's developer console. They don't include the outer self-invoking function wrapper and are ready for immediate execution in the console environment.

## Available Bookmarklets

1. **Chords to Markdown**: Converts chord sheets from Ultimate Guitar to Markdown format.
2. **Chords to TXT**: Extracts chord information from Ultimate Guitar and saves it as a text file.
3. **Copy Full HTML**: Copies the full HTML of the current page to the clipboard.
4. **Count Words**: Counts the approximate number of words on the current page.
5. **GA Tag Review**: Identifies and lists Google Analytics tags present on the page.
6. **Highlight H1**: Extracts content from the page starting with the selected text as an H1 heading.
7. **HTML to Markdown**: Converts the current page's content to Markdown format.
8. **Internal Links to TXT**: Extracts all internal links from the current page and saves them as a text file.
9.  **Jump Links to Console**: Identifies and validates all jump links (anchor links) on the page.
10. **Schema to TXT**: Extracts JSON-LD and Microdata schema information from the page.
11. **Tag Checker**: Checks for various tags and scripts, with a focus on Botify-related elements.

## Usage

- **For bookmarklets**: Use the minified versions. Create a new bookmark in your browser and paste the minified code into the URL field.
- **For development/customization**: Refer to the unminified versions for readable and modifiable code.
- **For quick testing**: Use the console-ready versions by pasting them directly into your browser's developer console.
